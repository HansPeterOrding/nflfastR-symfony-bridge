Introduction
============

This bundle was created, to enable coders in the Symfony bubble to work easily with the data provided by NflFastR. Therefore, it introduces different [import strategies](import_strategies.md) that all create object oriented [entities](entities.md) where the data is [mapped](field_mapping.md)  in a very structured approach.

If you have not heard of NflFastR so far, it is a good idea to take a closer look to the [project page](https://www.nflfastr.com/index.html). This project provides all roster and play by play data of the NFL seasons starting in 1999.
